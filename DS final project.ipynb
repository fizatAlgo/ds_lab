It includes identifying tasks, assigning them to team members, setting deadlines, and checking progress to make sure the project finishes on time and within budget.\nGood task management is very important for project success because it helps teams stay organized, prioritize their work, and complete tasks efficiently.\n1. **2. Problem Statement:**\nManaging daily tasks become difficult when tasks are unorganized, forgotten or scatterd across different places. Students and professionals often lose track of their important activities because their is no simple digital system to store ,update and monitor tasks.  \nThis project solve this problem by creating a Task manager that store tasks efficiently using a linked list ,allowing user to add , search, deleted and  manage tasks easily in a structured way. \n**3. Objectives:**\n•\tTo manage and store daily tasks in an efficient structure\n•\tTo organize tasks using linked list for easy insertion and deletion\n•\tTo track tasks status such as pending or completed \n•\tTo allow searching task by task title or ID\n•\tTo update task priority and status for better management\n•\tTo improve user productivity by maintaining a simple, fast task list\n**4. Tools & Technologies**\n•\tProgramming language: C++/Python\n•\tIDE: Dev C++/Visual Studio Code\n•\tData Structure Used:\n            1. Singly Linked List →to store tasks dynamically\n            2. Pointers →to link nodes\n            3. Traversal →for displaying and searching tasks \n\n\n\n**5. SYSTEM DESIGN**\n Data Structure Used\nThis project uses a Singly Linked List. Each task is represented as a node in the linked list. Every node contains task information and a pointer to the next node.\n**5.1Task Node Structure:**\n•\tTask ID\n•\tTask Name\n•\tPriority\n•\tDuration\n•\tCategory\n•\tDeadline\n•\tStatus\n•\tNext Pointer\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"d013b9ff-e8d3-417c-abff-5772379f9180","cell_type":"markdown","source":"6. IMPLEMENTATION\nThis section explains the implementation of the Task Manager using a Singly Linked List in Python. The project is implemented using object-oriented programming concepts, where each task is stored as a node in the linked list.\n6.1 Task Node Class\nThe TaskNode class represents a single task in the system. Each object of this class acts as a node of the linked list.\nEach task node stores task information along with a pointer to the next node.\nTaskNode Class:\n \nExplanation:\n•\ttask_id: uniquely identifies each task\n•\ttask_name: describes the task\n•\tpriority: defines task importance\n•\tstatus: initially set to Pending\n•\tnext: stores reference to the next node\nThis structure allows tasks to be stored dynamically without using fixed-size memory.\n\n6.2 Task Manager Class:\nThe TaskManager class controls all operations of the linked list. It maintains a head pointer which points to the first task in the list.\nTask_Manager Initialization\n \n\n 6.3Add Task Operation\nThis function adds a new task at the end of the linked list.\n \nExplanation\n•\tA new node is created.\n•\tIf the list is empty, it becomes the head.\n•\tOtherwise, traversal continues until the last node.\n•\tThe last node’s next pointer is updated.\n6.4View Tasks Operation:\nThis function displays all tasks stored in the linked list. \n \nExplanation\n•\tTraverses from the head node.\n•\tDisplays task details one by one.\n•\tHelps users see current task status.\n6.5 Delete Task Operation\nThis function deletes a task using its Task ID.  \nExplanation\n•\tSearches for the task using Task ID.\n•\tUpdates pointers to remove the node.\n•\tDemonstrates deletion in a singly linked list.\n6.6 Update Task Status\nThis function updates the status of a task to Completed.  \nExplanation\n•\tTraverses the list to find the task.\n•\tUpdates task status.\n•\tUseful for tracking task completion.\n6.7 Sort Tasks by Priority\nThis function sorts tasks using the Bubble Sort algorithm based on priority.\n Explanation\n•\tBubble Sort is applied on\nlinked list nodes.\n•\tPriority order is predefined.\n•\tTask data is swapped instead of nodes.\n•\tImproves task organization.\n6.8 Main Program Execution\nThe program uses a menu-driven interface for user interace\n71.  . CONCLUSION: \nThis project helped me understand linked lists in a simple way. I learned how tasks can be stored using nodes and how data structures are used in real programs. This project also improved my programming and logical thinking skills.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"4d2311f5-d3ac-4bd8-bbae-1aec1c3b6b72","cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
